# Notes:
# - After copying to .env, you can start the backend and frontend as documented in README.md.
# - If you are using AWS credentials, consider using an IAM role on EC2 instead of hardcoding keys.
# - Keep secrets out of version control. Use OS environment variables or a secrets manager in production.
